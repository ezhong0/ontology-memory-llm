Philosophy Tests

Tests that verify vision principles are embodied in system behavior.

These tests use a combination of:
- Traditional assertions (mechanical verification)
- LLM-based evaluation (semantic verification)

Vision principles tested:
1. Epistemic Humility - System knows what it doesn't know
2. Dual Truth - DB + Memory in equilibrium
3. Graceful Forgetting - Consolidation, not deletion
4. Explainability - All responses traceable to sources
5. Problem of Reference - Entity resolution correctness
6. Temporal Validity - Memories decay and are validated
7. Learning & Adaptation - System improves with each interaction
