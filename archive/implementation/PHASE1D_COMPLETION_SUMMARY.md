## Phase 1D Components Implemented

### 1. Multi-Signal Retrieval Scoring ✅

**Location**: `src/domain/services/multi_signal_scorer.py`

**Implementation**:
- **5 Signal Scoring Algorithm**:
  1. Semantic similarity (cosine distance on embeddings)
  2. Entity overlap (Jaccard similarity)
  3. Recency (exponential temporal decay)
  4. Importance (stored importance score)
  5. Reinforcement (validation count for semantic memories)

- **Passive Confidence Decay**: Exponential decay formula applied at scoring time
- **Strategy-Based Weights**: Different weights for exploratory vs targeted retrieval
- **Performance**: <100ms for scoring 100+ candidates (deterministic, no LLM)

**Integration Points**:
- `src/application/use_cases/process_chat_message.py` (lines 438-500)
- `src/api/dependencies.py` (MultiSignalScorer in DI container)
- `src/domain/value_objects/__init__.py` (MemoryCandidate, QueryContext exports)

**Test Coverage**:
- 29 unit tests in `tests/unit/domain/test_multi_signal_scorer.py`
- Tests cover all 5 signals, decay calculations, and edge cases
- ✅ All tests passing

---

### 2. Consolidation Service ✅

**Location**: `src/domain/services/consolidation_service.py`

**Implementation**:
- **LLM-Based Synthesis**: Uses LLM to create coherent summaries from multiple memories
- **Consolidation Scopes**:
  - Entity scope (all memories about a customer)
  - Topic scope (memories matching predicate patterns) - Phase 1 placeholder
  - Session window (recent N sessions) - Phase 1 placeholder
- **Fallback Strategy**: Creates basic summary if LLM synthesis fails
- **Confidence Boosting**: Reinforces semantic memories confirmed in consolidation
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts for LLM synthesis with fallback

**API Endpoints**: `src/api/routes/consolidation.py`
- `POST /api/v1/consolidate` - Trigger consolidation for a scope
- `GET /api/v1/summaries/{scope_type}/{scope_identifier}` - Retrieve summaries
- `GET /api/v1/consolidate/status` - Check consolidation thresholds

**DI Setup**: `src/api/dependencies.py`
- `get_consolidation_service()` - Full service with all dependencies
- `get_consolidation_trigger_service()` - Threshold checking service
- `get_summary_repository()` - Summary storage

**Test Coverage**:
- 12 unit tests in `tests/unit/domain/services/test_consolidation_service_unit.py`
- Tests cover entity consolidation, fallback, and LLM synthesis
- ✅ All tests passing

---

### 3. Procedural Memory Service ✅

**Location**: `src/domain/services/procedural_memory_service.py`

**Implementation**:
- **Pattern Detection**: Analyzes episodic memories to find behavioral patterns
- **Feature Extraction**: Intent classification, entity type extraction, topic extraction
- **Frequency Analysis**: Basic co-occurrence pattern mining
- **Pattern Storage**: Stores learned heuristics as ProceduralMemory entities
- **Query Augmentation**: Enriches queries with learned patterns using vector similarity

**Pattern Types Detected**:
- "When user asks about payments, also retrieve invoice info"
- "When querying customer status, include order history"
- "When asking about orders, check payment status"

**API Endpoints**: `src/api/routes/procedural.py`
- `POST /api/v1/patterns/detect` - Detect patterns from episodic memories
- `GET /api/v1/patterns` - Retrieve user's learned patterns
- `POST /api/v1/patterns/augment` - Augment query with patterns

**DI Setup**: `src/api/dependencies.py`
- `get_procedural_service()` - Pattern detection and augmentation service
- `get_procedural_repository()` - Procedural memory storage

**Test Coverage**:
- 31 unit tests in `tests/unit/domain/services/test_procedural_service_unit.py`
- Tests cover pattern detection, feature extraction, and query augmentation
- ✅ All tests passing

---

- 100% type annotations on all public methods
- Mypy compatibility (some pre-existing warnings in infrastructure layer)
- Explicit return types and parameter types

✅ **Logging & Observability**:
- Structured logging with `structlog` throughout
- Key events logged (pattern_detected, consolidation_started, memories_scored)
- Error logging with context

✅ **Error Handling**:
- Domain exceptions for business logic errors
- API layer converts to appropriate HTTP status codes
- Graceful degradation (query augmentation fails silently)

## Performance Characteristics

Based on design targets:

| Operation | Target P95 | Implementation |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Multi-signal scoring | <100ms | ✅ Deterministic (no LLM) |
| Pattern detection | <1s | ✅ Analyzes up to 500 episodes |
| Consolidation | <2s | ✅ Includes LLM synthesis |
| Query augmentation | <200ms | ✅ Embedding + vector retrieval |

**Note**: Performance targets are design estimates. Integration testing in Phase 2 will validate actual latencies.

## Remaining Work (Out of Scope for Phase 1)

The following items are explicitly Phase 2+ features per PHASE1_ROADMAP.md:

### Phase 2 (Post-Deployment):
- [ ] Background consolidation triggers (automatic, not manual)
- [ ] Advanced pattern detection using ML (current: frequency analysis)
- [ ] Topic and session_window consolidation (entity scope only in Phase 1)
- [ ] Performance optimization with pre-computation
- [ ] Learned retrieval weights from user corrections
- [ ] Integration testing with real workloads

### Phase 3 (Learning from Usage):
- [ ] Meta-learning for decay rates
- [ ] Adaptive confidence thresholds
- [ ] Personalized retrieval strategies
- [ ] Advanced sequence mining for procedural patterns

---

## Known Limitations (Phase 1)

These limitations are acceptable for Phase 1 and will be addressed in Phase 2+:

1. **Consolidation Triggers**: Manual only (no background job scheduler)
2. **Pattern Detection**: Basic frequency analysis (not ML-based)
3. **Topic Consolidation**: Raises "not yet implemented" error
4. **Session Window Consolidation**: Raises "not yet implemented" error
5. **Performance**: Targets are estimates, not validated with production load
6. **LLM Fallback**: Consolidation uses placeholder LLM response in unit tests
