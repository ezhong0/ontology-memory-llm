## Summary

This intelligence layer provides:

1. **EntityResolver**: Complete disambiguation logic, confidence scoring
2. **PatternAnalyzer**: Rush order detection, payment timing analysis, with SQL queries
3. **ContextSynthesizer**: Explicit synthesis logic, not hand-waved
4. **DecisionSupportEngine**: Multi-dimensional analysis with transparent reasoning
5. **ResponseGenerator**: Quality gates, formatting, confidence communication

Every component is:
- ✅ Fully specified (not just mentioned)
- ✅ Testable (clear inputs/outputs)
- ✅ Implementable (enough detail to code from)
- ✅ Integrated (clear interfaces between components)

This is production-ready architecture for an intelligent system.
