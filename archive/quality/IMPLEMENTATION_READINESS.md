## High-Priority Improvements Completed

### 1. ✅ HEURISTICS_CALIBRATION.md Created

**File**: `/Users/edwardzhong/Projects/adenAssessment2/HEURISTICS_CALIBRATION.md`

**Purpose**: Consolidates all 43 numeric parameters used across the memory system, marking each as "Phase 1 heuristic - requires Phase 2 tuning."

**Key Contents**:
- **Confidence and Decay Parameters**: Reinforcement boosts (0.15, 0.10, 0.05, 0.02), consolidation boost (0.05), decay rates (0.01/day)
- **Entity Resolution Confidence Scores**: Five-stage resolution confidences (1.0, 0.95, 0.70-0.85, 0.60, 0.85)
- **Retrieval Scoring Weights**: Four strategy-based weight distributions for different query types
- **Learning Thresholds**: Minimum sample requirements for Phase 2/3 calibration
- **Tuning Metrics**: Expected Phase 2 measurements to calibrate each parameter
- **Critical Unknowns**: 5 key questions that can only be answered with operational data

**Impact**:
- Engineers know which values are heuristics vs justified constants
- Each value has documented rationale and expected tuning approach
- Clear data requirements for Phase 2 calibration (e.g., "100+ memories with corrections")
- Prevents premature optimization by marking all values for empirical validation

**Example - Reinforcement Confidence Boosts**:
```markdown
| Event | Confidence Boost | Justification | Phase 2 Tuning Required |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|
| First Reinforcement | +0.15 | Strong signal of importance | Yes - analyze correction rate by boost level |
| Second Reinforcement | +0.10 | Diminishing returns principle | Yes - measure impact on retrieval quality |
...

Phase 2 Data Requirements:
- Minimum 100+ semantic memories with reinforcement events
- Track correction rate by reinforcement count
- Expected Tuning: Likely need different boosts for different fact types
```

## Remaining Recommendations (Medium/Low Priority)

These are **nice-to-have** improvements that can be addressed during or after Phase 1 implementation:

### Medium Priority

**1. Document Embedding Strategy**
- Currently scattered across documents
- Should have dedicated section in DESIGN.md or separate EMBEDDING_DESIGN.md
- Questions to address:
  - Which embedding model? (Currently: text-embedding-ada-002)
  - When to generate embeddings? (Async after memory creation)
  - How to handle embedding updates?
  - Batching strategy for efficiency?

**2. Consolidation Confidence Boost Justification**
- +0.05 boost documented in HEURISTICS_CALIBRATION.md as requiring Phase 2 tuning
- Consider whether boost should depend on episodic source diversity
- Mark as tunable parameter with expected range (0.03-0.10)

### Low Priority

**3. Timeline Examples as Appendix**
- LIFECYCLE_DESIGN.md timeline is excellent but very long (contributes to 800+ line document)
- Consider moving to appendix to reduce main document cognitive load
- **Decision**: Keep as-is for now (aids understanding), revisit if feedback suggests confusion

**4. Cost-Benefit Analysis per Learning Dimension**
- LEARNING_DESIGN.md could quantify expected benefits
- Example: "Extraction Quality learning: Cost = complexity of pattern mining, Benefit = 20% fewer incorrect memories (estimated)"
- Helps prioritize which learning dimensions to implement first in Phase 2
- **Decision**: Defer to Phase 2 planning (requires operational metrics to estimate benefits)

---

## Cross-Document Consistency

### ✅ Verified Consistent Across All Documents

**Terminology**:
- "Canonical entities" vs "aliases" (entity resolution)
- "Episodic → Semantic → Procedural" (transformation layers)
- "Active, Aging, Superseded, Invalidated" (lifecycle states)

**Design Patterns**:
- JSONB for variable/context-specific data
- Structured fields for frequently queried data
- On-demand computation for simple formulas (passive computation)
- Pre-computation only for expensive operations (embeddings)

**Vision Principles** referenced consistently:
- Memory Transformation (Raw → Episodic → Semantic → Procedural)
- Graceful Forgetting (decay, aging states)
- Epistemic Humility (never 100% confident, expose uncertainty)
- Explainability (source tracking, confidence factors)

---

## Implementation Guidance

### Phase 1 Essential Features (Build First)

**Core Tables** (10 tables from DESIGN.md):
1. `chat_events` - Raw conversation layer
2. `canonical_entities` - Canonical entity records
3. `entity_aliases` - User-specific aliases
4. `episodic_memories` - Individual events with coreference chains
5. `semantic_memories` - Abstracted facts (Subject-Predicate-Object)
6. `procedural_memories` - Learned patterns (deferred to Phase 2)
7. `memory_summaries` - Session summaries (deferred to Phase 2)
8. `domain_ontology` - Business domain schema
9. `memory_conflicts` - Conflict tracking
10. `system_config` - Configuration and heuristics

**Core Algorithms**:
1. **Entity Resolution** (ENTITY_RESOLUTION_DESIGN.md):
   - Five-stage algorithm: Exact → User-specific → Fuzzy → Coreference → Disambiguation
   - Use heuristics from HEURISTICS_CALIBRATION.md (fuzzy threshold: 0.70, stage confidences: 1.0, 0.95, 0.70-0.85, 0.60, 0.85)

2. **Retrieval** (RETRIEVAL_DESIGN.md):
   - Three-stage: Query Understanding → Candidate Generation → Ranking & Selection
   - Multi-signal scoring: semantic similarity, entity overlap, temporal relevance, importance, reinforcement
   - Use strategy weights from HEURISTICS_CALIBRATION.md (factual: 0.25, 0.40, 0.20, 0.10, 0.05)

3. **Lifecycle Management** (LIFECYCLE_DESIGN.md):
   - Four states: ACTIVE, AGING, SUPERSEDED, INVALIDATED
   - Passive state computation (compute on-demand, no background jobs)
   - Passive decay computation (apply at retrieval time)
   - Use decay parameters from HEURISTICS_CALIBRATION.md (decay rate: 0.01/day, validation threshold: 90 days)

**Core API Endpoints** (10 Phase 1 endpoints from API_DESIGN.md):
- `POST /chat` - Primary interface
- Memory CRUD: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE
- Entity resolution: POST /entities/resolve, POST /entities/disambiguate, GET /entities
- Health check: GET /health

### Phase 1 Data Collection Requirements

**Critical**: Log ALL operations for Phase 2 learning:
- All entity resolution events (stage, confidence, user overrides)
- All retrieval events (query, strategy, top-k results, user actions)
- All memory corrections (what changed, why)
- All consolidation events (episodic sources, resulting semantic memory)
- All disambiguation prompts (user choices)

**Instrumentation**:
```python
# Example: Log every retrieval event for Phase 2 analysis
retrieval_log = {
    'query': query_text,
    'query_type': detected_query_type,
    'strategy_used': 'factual_entity_focused',
    'top_k_results': [memory_ids],
    'relevance_scores': [scores],
    'user_clicked': clicked_memory_id,  # implicit feedback
    'timestamp': now()
}
```

**Storage**: Add `operation_logs` table for Phase 2 analysis (not in current DESIGN.md, add if needed)

### Phase 2 Trigger Conditions

When operational data reaches minimum thresholds (from HEURISTICS_CALIBRATION.md):
- 100+ semantic memories with lifecycle events → Calibrate confidence boosts
- 500+ retrieval events → Tune strategy weights
- 100+ entity resolution events → Calibrate fuzzy thresholds
- 50+ consolidation events → Tune consolidation boost

**Expected Timeline**:
- Phase 1 MVP: 3-6 months development
- Phase 1 Deployment: 1-3 months data collection
- Phase 2 Calibration: When minimum samples reached (varies by metric)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items ✅

**1. Database Performance**:
- PostgreSQL + pgvector is proven technology
- Performance targets are realistic (<50ms semantic search, <100ms total)
- Can optimize with indexes if needed

**2. Core Algorithm Complexity**:
- Five-stage entity resolution is straightforward
- Multi-signal retrieval is well-understood pattern
- Passive computation reduces operational complexity

**3. Phase Distinction**:
- Clear separation of essential vs enhancements vs learning
- Phase 1 is implementable without machine learning complexity

### Medium Risk Items ⚠️

**1. Heuristic Accuracy**:
- 43 numeric parameters are educated guesses
- **Mitigation**: HEURISTICS_CALIBRATION.md documents tuning requirements
- **Mitigation**: Phase 2 calibration with real data
- **Acceptable**: Phase 1 heuristics are conservative and will function

**2. Embedding Model Dependency**:
- Tied to OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 (1536 dimensions)
- **Mitigation**: Model is stable and widely used
- **Risk**: If model changes, need to re-embed all memories
- **Recommendation**: Document embedding versioning strategy

**3. Domain Database Integration**:
- Assumes external ERP-style schema exists
- **Mitigation**: Mock domain DB for testing
- **Requirement**: Clear schema documentation for each deployment

### No High Risk Items ✅
