# First Principles Scenario Evaluation

**Purpose**: Systematically evaluate each of the 33 scenarios (CORE/ADJACENT/STRETCH) from first principles to determine if the current architectural approach is the best, most elegant, high-quality way to implement each feature.

**Methodology**: For each scenario, ask:
1. What is the fundamental problem?
2. What does the architecture propose?
3. Is there a simpler/better/more elegant approach?
4. What is the quality assessment?

## CORE SCENARIOS (15 scenarios - Must have for project)

### S1.1: Explicit Fact Learning (Semantic Memory)

**Fundamental Problem**:
- User explicitly teaches system a fact: "Delta Industries is NET15"
- System must store it, attribute high confidence (user said it), link to entity
- System must retrieve it later when relevant

**Current Architecture**:
```
User input → NER (extract entities) → Entity linking (resolve to DB) →
Create memory (kind=semantic, confidence=0.95, entity_link) →
Store in app.memories with embedding → Done
```

**First Principles Analysis**:

Is this the right approach? Let me think through alternatives:

**Alternative 1: Store as key-value**
```
customer:delta_industries:payment_terms = "NET15"
```
- ✅ Simple, fast lookup
- ❌ Doesn't work for fuzzy matching ("What are Delta's terms?")
- ❌ Doesn't work for semantic search ("Who are our NET15 customers?")
- ❌ Rigid schema (what if user says "Delta likes to pay via ACH"?)

**Alternative 2: Store only in database**
```
ALTER TABLE domain.customers ADD COLUMN custom_fields JSONB;
UPDATE customers SET custom_fields = '{"payment_terms": "NET15"}'
```
- ✅ Simple, co-located with customer data
- ❌ Doesn't capture attribution (who said this? when? confidence?)
- ❌ Doesn't support fuzzy recall ("remind me about Delta's preferences")
- ❌ Mixes domain data with learned information

**Alternative 3: Current approach (app.memories with vector embedding)**
```
memory: {
  text: "Delta Industries payment terms: NET15",
  kind: "semantic",
  confidence: 0.95,
  entity_links: ["customer-delta-industries"],
  embedding: [vector],
  created_at: timestamp
}
```
- ✅ Flexible (any fact can be stored)
- ✅ Semantic search works ("remind me about Delta")
- ✅ Attribution tracked (confidence, timestamp, source)
- ✅ Doesn't pollute domain schema
- ⚠ More complex than key-value

**Verdict**: Current approach is CORRECT
- **Why**: Flexibility + semantic search + attribution are essential
- **Quality**: EXCELLENT
- **Simplification opportunity**: None - this is the right level of complexity

---

### S1.2: Episodic Memory Creation

**Fundamental Problem**:
- User asks "What's the balance on INV-2201?"
- System should remember that user is INTERESTED in this invoice
- Later queries should be influenced by this interest

**Current Architecture**:
```
User query → Answer from DB →
Create episodic memory ("User inquired about invoice INV-2201", confidence=0.8) →
Store in app.memories (kind=episodic, entity_link=invoice) →
Future retrievals weighted by recency of interest
```

**First Principles Analysis**:

**Alternative 1: Don't store queries at all**
- ✅ Simpler
- ❌ Lose user interest signals
- ❌ Can't answer "What invoices have I been asking about?"
- ❌ Can't prioritize contextually relevant information

**Alternative 2: Store only query text**
```
app.query_history (user_id, query_text, timestamp)
```
- ✅ Simpler than embeddings
- ❌ Can't do semantic similarity ("similar inquiries")
- ❌ Harder to link to entities

**Alternative 3: Current approach (episodic memories with embeddings)**
```
memory: {
  text: "User inquired about invoice balance for INV-2201",
  kind: "episodic",
  confidence: 0.8,
  entity_links: ["invoice-2201", "customer-delta"],
  embedding: [vector]
}
```
- ✅ Semantic search works
- ✅ Entity links enable "recent context" retrieval
- ✅ Unified with other memories (same search infrastructure)
- ⚠ More storage (embedding for every query)

**Optimization**: Do we need embeddings for ALL episodic memories?
- **Answer**: Not all. Only for "significant" queries
- **Threshold**: Skip embedding for simple lookups ("What's the status of X?")
- **Store**: Queries that indicate USER INTENT or DECISION ("Should I extend terms?")

**Verdict**: Current approach is GOOD, minor optimization possible
- **Why**: Unified memory system is elegant
- **Quality**: VERY GOOD
- **Improvement**: Add filter to skip trivial queries from episodic memory

---

### S1.3: Memory Consolidation Across Sessions

**Fundamental Problem**:
- After 4 sessions about Delta Industries, have 15 scattered memories
- Each retrieval returns subset, may miss important facts
- Need consolidated view for efficiency

**Current Architecture** (UPDATED):
```
Trigger: 10 sessions per entity OR weekly OR >50 memories →
Fetch unconsolidated memories →
Extract structured facts (LLM, preserves confidence + sources) →
Generate prose summary from facts →
Store in app.memory_summaries (structured_facts + prose) →
Mark source memories as deprecated (keep for audit)
```

**First Principles Analysis**:

**Why consolidate at all?**
- **Problem**: Retrieving 50 memories every query is slow + expensive
- **Problem**: LLM context window limited (can't fit all memories)
- **Problem**: Redundant information across memories

**Alternative 1: Don't consolidate, just retrieve smartly**
```
Retrieve top-K most relevant memories (K=5-10)
Don't worry about redundancy
```
- ✅ Simpler (no consolidation logic)
- ❌ May miss important facts buried in lower-ranked memories
- ❌ Redundancy wastes context window
- ❌ No temporal synthesis ("pattern changed over time")

**Alternative 2: Consolidate all memories into one mega-summary**
```
All Delta memories → One big summary
```
- ✅ Simple (one summary per entity)
- ❌ Information loss (consolidation loses detail)
- ❌ No versioning (can't see how things evolved)
- ❌ Massive LLM call for large memory sets

**Alternative 3: Current approach (periodic consolidation + structured facts)**
```
Consolidate per entity when threshold hit →
Extract facts FIRST (prevents loss) →
Generate prose from facts →
Keep hierarchy (memories → summaries → meta-summaries)
```
- ✅ Preserves information (structured facts)
- ✅ Efficient (retrieve summary instead of 50 memories)
- ✅ Versioned (can see summary evolution)
- ✅ Scalable (can consolidate summaries into meta-summaries)
- ⚠ Complex (requires consolidation logic)

**Critical design decision**: Extract structured facts BEFORE prose
- **Why**: Prose generation is lossy (LLM may omit details)
- **How**: LLM extracts facts with confidence + sources → Then generates prose
- **Benefit**: Can always regenerate prose from facts if needed

**Verdict**: Current approach is EXCELLENT
- **Why**: Structured facts prevent information loss (critical insight)
- **Quality**: EXCELLENT
- **No simplification**: This is already well-designed

---

### S1.4: Memory Recall in Context

**Fundamental Problem**:
- User asks "When should we expect payment from Delta on INV-2201?"
- Need to combine: DB facts (invoice date, amount) + Memory (NET15 terms) + Pattern (pays 2 days early)
- Must synthesize into coherent answer

**Current Architecture**:
```
User query → Extract entities (Delta, INV-2201) →
DB query (invoice details) →
Memory retrieval (payment terms, patterns) →
LLM synthesis (combine all sources) →
Response with attribution
```

**First Principles Analysis**:

**Alternative 1: Just query database**
```
SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE invoice_id = 'INV-2201'
Return: "Invoice due Oct 30"
```
- ✅ Simple, fast
- ❌ Misses learned knowledge (NET15 stored in memory, not DB)
- ❌ Misses patterns (pays early)
- ❌ Not helpful (user could query DB themselves)

**Alternative 2: Retrieve memories, let user synthesize**
```
Response: "Invoice INV-2201 details: [DB data]
Related memories:
- Delta is NET15
- Delta pays 2 days early on average"
```
- ✅ Transparent (user sees sources)
- ❌ User has to do synthesis work
- ❌ Not conversational
- ❌ Doesn't feel intelligent

**Alternative 3: Current approach (LLM synthesis)**
```
Gather: DB facts + relevant memories + patterns →
LLM prompt: "Synthesize answer about payment timing" →
Response: "Invoice due Oct 30 (NET15 terms). Based on Delta's pattern
of paying 2 days early, expect payment around Oct 28."
```
- ✅ Conversational and intelligent
- ✅ Synthesizes across sources
- ✅ Provides reasoning
- ⚠ Requires LLM call (latency + cost)

**Optimization question**: When is synthesis needed vs simple retrieval?
- **Simple query**: "What's the invoice amount?" → Just DB, no LLM synthesis
- **Complex query**: "When should we expect payment?" → Needs synthesis
- **Heuristic**: If query requires combining >1 source OR reasoning, use LLM

**Verdict**: Current approach is CORRECT
- **Why**: Synthesis is the core value proposition
- **Quality**: EXCELLENT
- **Optimization**: Skip LLM for simple fact retrieval queries

### S1.5: Conflict Detection and Resolution

**Fundamental Problem**:
- Memory A: "Kai Media prefers Thursday deliveries" (June 15, confidence 0.7)
- Memory B: "Kai Media prefers Friday deliveries" (Sept 10, confidence 0.8)
- System must detect conflict, ask user to resolve

**Current Architecture**:
```
Retrieval finds both memories →
Conflict detection: same entity + same attribute + different values →
Present to user with recency + confidence + reasoning →
User confirms → Update confidences (winner=0.95, loser=0.2, mark deprecated)
```

**First Principles Analysis**:

**Alternative 1: Last-write-wins (just use most recent)**
```
if memory_b.created_at > memory_a.created_at:
    use memory_b
    ignore memory_a
```
- ✅ Simple, no user interaction
- ❌ Silently overwrites old data (user might not know)
- ❌ Recency doesn't always mean correct (typo in recent entry)
- ❌ No conflict resolution transparency

**Alternative 2: Confidence-based (use highest confidence)**
```
if memory_b.confidence > memory_a.confidence:
    use memory_b
```
- ✅ Simple
- ❌ Old high-confidence memory might be outdated
- ❌ No user confirmation

**Alternative 3: Current approach (detect + ask user)**
```
Detect conflict → Present both with context → User chooses →
Update confidences accordingly
```
- ✅ Transparent (user knows conflict exists)
- ✅ User control (confirms correct value)
- ✅ Learns from resolution (boosts winner, deprecates loser)
- ⚠ Requires user interaction (friction)

**When to ask vs auto-resolve?**

**Auto-resolve (don't bother user)**:
- Confidence difference > 0.3 (0.9 vs 0.5 → use 0.9)
- Recency difference > 180 days (6 months old → use recent)
- One memory has validation flag (user previously confirmed)

**Ask user**:
- Similar confidence (both 0.7-0.8)
- Recent (both within 90 days)
- Critical attribute (payment terms, not minor preference)

**Verdict**: Current approach is CORRECT with refinement
- **Why**: User confirmation prevents silent errors
- **Quality**: VERY GOOD
- **Improvement**: Add auto-resolve heuristics for clear cases
