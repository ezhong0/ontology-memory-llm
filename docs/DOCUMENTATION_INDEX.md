- `archive/week0/`: Initial domain database integration research

**Why Archive?**
- Context for understanding decisions
- Tracking how design evolved
- Reference for "why we changed X"
- Not actively maintained, but preserved

---

## Documentation Standards

### Markdown Style

- **Headings**: Use `#` for title, `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections
- **Code blocks**: Always specify language (```python, ```sql, ```bash)
- **Links**: Relative links within docs, absolute for external
- **Tables**: For comparisons, metrics, parameters

### When to Create New Docs

**Create new doc when**:
- Introducing new architectural layer
- Designing new major feature (Phase 1C, 1D, etc.)
- Documenting new API surface
- Recording major design decision

**DON'T create new doc for**:
- Progress updates (update existing completion reports)
- Bug fixes (document in code comments)
- Minor clarifications (edit existing docs)
- Redundant information (check if existing doc can be updated)

### When to Update vs Archive

**Update existing doc when**:
- Design evolves incrementally
- Adding clarifications
- Fixing errors
- Current phase progress

**Archive doc when**:
- Design has fundamentally changed (old doc no longer accurate)
- Progress doc is superseded by newer summary
- Multiple docs cover same topic redundantly
- Historical context valuable but not current

## Documentation Map by Audience

### For New Developers

**Day 1: Orientation**

**Week 1: Core Concepts**
1. design/DESIGN.md - Complete specification
2. quality/PHASE1_ROADMAP.md - Implementation plan
3. reference/HEURISTICS_CALIBRATION.md - Configuration

### For Implementers

**Before starting feature**:
- Check design/DESIGN.md for specification
- Check quality/PHASE1_ROADMAP.md for phase scope
- Check implementation/FINAL_QUALITY_METRICS.md for current state

**During implementation**:
- Follow CLAUDE.md standards
- Reference design/*.md for algorithms
- Use quality/TESTING_PHILOSOPHY.md for tests

### For Reviewers

**Code quality check**:
- implementation/FINAL_QUALITY_METRICS.md - Current metrics
- implementation/CODE_QUALITY_COMPLETION_REPORT.md - Recent improvements
- CLAUDE.md - Coding standards

**Design alignment check**:
- design/DESIGN.md - Does implementation match spec?
- vision/DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md - Does it serve vision principles?
