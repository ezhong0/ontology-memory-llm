### ⚠️ Scenarios 15 & 17: Numbering Mismatch (Cosmetic Issue)

**Problem**: Scenarios 15 and 17 are swapped in the implementation

#### Scenario 15 (ProjectDescription.md)
**Expected**: "Audit trail / explainability"
```
User: "Why did you say Kai Media prefers Fridays?"
Expected: /explain returns memory IDs, similarity scores, chat events
```

**Actual**: Implemented as `test_scenario_17_explainability_provenance_tracking`

**Fix**: Rename `test_scenario_17_...` → `test_scenario_15_...`

#### Scenario 17 (ProjectDescription.md)
**Expected**: "Error handling when DB and memory disagree"
```
Context: Memory says "SO-1001 is fulfilled" but DB shows "in_fulfillment"
User: "Is SO-1001 complete?"
Expected: Prefer DB, respond with DB truth, mark memory outdated
```

**Actual**: Implemented as `test_scenario_15_memory_vs_db_conflict_trust_db`

**Fix**: Rename `test_scenario_15_...` → `test_scenario_17_...`

**Design Coverage**: ✅ Both scenarios use existing conflict detection (Phase 1B)

---

### ❌ Scenario 16: WRONG SCENARIO IMPLEMENTED

**ProjectDescription.md** says:
```
Scenario 16: Reminder creation from conversational intent

User: "If an invoice is still open 3 days before due, remind me."
Expected: Store semantic policy memory; on future /chat calls that
involve invoices, system checks due dates and surfaces proactive notices.
```

**What I implemented**:
```python
test_scenario_16_graceful_forgetting_consolidation
```

This is NOT in ProjectDescription.md. "Graceful Forgetting" is a vision principle, not a user journey. Consolidation is already tested in Scenarios 7 and 14.

#### Is Scenario 16 in the Design?

**YES!** ✅ Checking `models.py`:

```python
# Line 137: SemanticMemory
predicate_type = Column(Text, nullable=False)
# Includes: preference|requirement|observation|policy|attribute

# Lines 164-186: ProceduralMemory (Layer 5)
class ProceduralMemory(Base):
    trigger_pattern = Column(Text, nullable=False)
    trigger_features = Column(JSONB, nullable=False)  # {intent, entity_types, topics}
    action_heuristic = Column(Text, nullable=False)
    action_structure = Column(JSONB, nullable=False)  # {action_type, queries, predicates}
```

**How Scenario 16 works with existing design**:
1. User: "If invoice is open 3 days before due, remind me"
2. System creates **ProceduralMemory**:
   - `trigger_pattern`: "invoice due date approaching"
   - `trigger_features`: `{intent: "payment_reminder", entity_types: ["invoice"], topics: ["due_date"]}`
   - `action_heuristic`: "Check invoices.due_date, if open and (due_date - today) <= 3, surface reminder"
   - `action_structure`: `{action_type: "proactive_notice", queries: ["SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE status='open'"], predicates: []}`
3. On future `/chat` calls involving invoices, system:
   - Retrieves ProceduralMemory via semantic match
   - Executes trigger check
   - If conditions match, adds proactive notice to augmentation

**Conclusion**: Scenario 16 is fully supported by existing ProceduralMemory table and semantic extraction. No new features needed.

**Action**: Replace `test_scenario_16_graceful_forgetting_consolidation` with correct implementation.

### ❌ Scenario 18: WRONG SCENARIO IMPLEMENTED

**ProjectDescription.md** says:
```
Scenario 18: Task completion via conversation

User: "Mark the SLA investigation task for Kai Media as done and
summarize what we learned."
Expected: Return SQL patch suggestion (or mocked effect), store the
summary as semantic memory for future reasoning.
```

**What I implemented**:
```python
test_scenario_18_privacy_user_scoped_memories
```

This is NOT in ProjectDescription.md. User-scoping (privacy) is a cross-cutting concern validated by `user_id` parameter in all scenarios, not a distinct user journey.

#### Is Scenario 18 in the Design?

**YES!** ✅ Checking existing features:

1. **Semantic extraction (Phase 1B)**: Already implemented
2. **Domain augmentation**: Task queries exist in schema (`domain.tasks`)
3. **Store summary as semantic memory**: Standard semantic extraction flow

**How Scenario 18 works with existing design**:
1. User: "Mark the SLA investigation task for Kai Media as done and summarize what we learned"
2. System:
   - Resolves entities: "Kai Media", "SLA investigation task"
   - Domain augmentation: Queries `domain.tasks` to find task
   - Returns: "SQL patch suggestion" (or mocked update in Phase 1)
   - Semantic extraction: Extracts `{subject: "customer:kai_123", predicate: "sla_investigation_outcome", object_value: {type: "summary", value: "Learned that...", task_id: "..."}}`
   - Creates SemanticMemory with `predicate_type='observation'`
3. Future queries about Kai Media SLA can retrieve this semantic memory

**Conclusion**: Scenario 18 uses existing semantic extraction + domain queries. No new features needed.

**Action**: Replace `test_scenario_18_privacy_user_scoped_memories` with correct implementation.

## Verification Against Design

### Database Schema Coverage

Checked `/src/infrastructure/database/models.py`:

✅ **All required tables exist**:
- `ChatEvent` (Layer 1): Raw events
- `CanonicalEntity`, `EntityAlias` (Layer 2): Entity resolution
- `EpisodicMemory` (Layer 3): Events with meaning
- `SemanticMemory` (Layer 4): Facts with lifecycle (includes `predicate_type='policy'`)
- `ProceduralMemory` (Layer 5): Learned heuristics (for Scenario 16)
- `MemorySummary` (Layer 6): Cross-session consolidation
- `MemoryConflict`: Conflict tracking
- `DomainOntology`: Relationship semantics
- `SystemConfig`: Heuristics

✅ **All required features exist**:
- Entity resolution (Phase 1A): Exact/alias/fuzzy/coreference ✅
- Semantic extraction (Phase 1B): Triple extraction, conflict detection ✅
- Domain augmentation (Phase 1C): DB queries, joins ✅
- Memory scoring (Phase 1D): Multi-signal retrieval ✅
- Policy memory: `predicate_type='policy'` ✅
- Procedural memory: Full table with triggers ✅
- Consolidation: Scenarios 7, 14 ✅
- Explainability: Provenance in DTOs ✅
- Conflict detection: `MemoryConflict` table ✅

## Summary of Required Fixes

### 1. Rename (Numbering Fix)
```bash
# Swap scenarios 15 ↔ 17
test_scenario_15_memory_vs_db_conflict_trust_db → test_scenario_17_...
test_scenario_17_explainability_provenance_tracking → test_scenario_15_...
```

### 2. Replace Scenario 16
**Remove**: `test_scenario_16_graceful_forgetting_consolidation` (not in ProjectDescription)

**Add**: `test_scenario_16_reminder_creation_from_intent`
```python
@pytest.mark.e2e
@pytest.mark.asyncio
@pytest.mark.skip(reason="TODO: Implement procedural memory extraction")
async def test_scenario_16_reminder_creation_from_intent(...):
    """
    SCENARIO 16: Reminder creation from conversational intent

    Vision Principles Tested:
    - Procedural Memory (policy extraction)
    - Proactive Intelligence (trigger-based reminders)

    User: "If an invoice is still open 3 days before due, remind me."
    Expected: Store procedural/policy memory; on future /chat calls
             involving invoices, check trigger and surface proactive notice.
    """
    # ARRANGE: Seed invoice near due date
    # ACT: User states policy
    # ASSERT: ProceduralMemory created with trigger
    # ACT: Later query about invoices
    # ASSERT: System surfaces proactive reminder
```

### 3. Replace Scenario 18
**Remove**: `test_scenario_18_privacy_user_scoped_memories` (not in ProjectDescription)

**Add**: `test_scenario_18_task_completion_via_conversation`
```python
@pytest.mark.e2e
@pytest.mark.asyncio
@pytest.mark.skip(reason="TODO: Implement task update via conversation")
async def test_scenario_18_task_completion_via_conversation(...):
    """
    SCENARIO 18: Task completion via conversation

    Vision Principles Tested:
    - Domain Augmentation (task queries)
    - Semantic Extraction (summary storage)

    User: "Mark the SLA investigation task for Kai Media as done and
          summarize what we learned."
    Expected: Return SQL patch suggestion (or mocked effect),
             store summary as semantic memory.
    """
    # ARRANGE: Seed task
    # ACT: User completes task with summary
    # ASSERT: SQL patch returned (or mocked)
    # ASSERT: Semantic memory created with summary
```

## Conclusion

**Status**: ⚠️ 4 scenarios need fixing

**Issues**:
1. Scenarios 15 & 17: Numbering swap (cosmetic)
2. Scenario 16: Wrong scenario (graceful forgetting ≠ reminder creation)
3. Scenario 18: Wrong scenario (privacy ≠ task completion)

**Good News**:
- ✅ All 18 scenarios from ProjectDescription.md ARE in the design
- ✅ No additional features required
- ✅ Existing Phase 1A-1D infrastructure supports all scenarios
- ✅ ProceduralMemory table exists for Scenario 16
- ✅ Semantic extraction exists for Scenario 18

**Next Steps**:
1. Rename test_scenario_15 ↔ test_scenario_17
2. Rewrite test_scenario_16 (correct scenario)
3. Rewrite test_scenario_18 (correct scenario)
4. Update documentation

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours (mostly test rewriting)
