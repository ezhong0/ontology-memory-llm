## What Just Happened?

Your documentation has been **completely overhauled** based on a deep analysis of your actual codebase (~12,000 lines of production code).

**Key Changes**:
- ✅ **100+ old docs** → **~10 focused new docs** + **50+ archived**
- ✅ **Reality-based**: Reflects actual implementation, not aspirational features
- ✅ **Audience-focused**: Organized by who's reading (new devs, architects, etc.)
- ✅ **Protected files untouched**: VISION.md, DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md, CLAUDE.md, ProjectDescription.md
- ✅ **Nothing deleted**: All legacy docs preserved in `archive_legacy_docs/`

## 🎓 Philosophy

**New documentation follows**:

1. **Reality-Based** - Document what exists, not what's planned
2. **Audience-Focused** - Organized by who's reading
3. **Practical** - Answer "how do I..." questions
4. **Maintainable** - Fewer, focused documents
5. **Discoverable** - Clear entry points and cross-references

## 🚦 Next Steps

### For You (Project Owner)

1. **Review new structure**: [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)
2. **Verify protected files**: Check CLAUDE.md, VISION.md, etc. are untouched
3. **Check archived docs**: Ensure everything you need is accessible
4. **Provide feedback**: Any missing documentation?

### For New Developers

1. **Start here**: [`docs/getting-started/QUICKSTART.md`](docs/getting-started/QUICKSTART.md)
2. **Understand architecture**: [`docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md`](docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md)
3. **Read philosophy**: [`docs/vision/VISION.md`](docs/vision/VISION.md)

### For Team

1. **Update bookmarks**: Point to new documentation structure
2. **Use new entry point**: [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)
3. **Reference archive**: When historical context needed

---

## 📝 Future Work (Optional)

**Recommended additional documentation**:

1. `docs/development/WORKFLOW.md` - Day-to-day development
2. `docs/api/ENDPOINTS.md` - Complete API documentation
3. `docs/database/SCHEMA.md` - Database schema with ER diagram
4. `docs/testing/GUIDE.md` - Testing guide
5. `docs/deployment/GUIDE.md` - Deployment instructions

**Extract from legacy**:
- Useful parts of DESIGN.md → new architecture docs
- Entity resolution algorithm → architecture/ENTITY_RESOLUTION.md
- Retrieval design → architecture/RETRIEVAL.md
