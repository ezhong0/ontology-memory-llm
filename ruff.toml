    # ==========================================
    # INTENTIONAL PATTERNS - FRAMEWORK CONVENTIONS
    # ==========================================

    # B008: Function calls in argument defaults
    # REASON: FastAPI Depends() pattern (31 instances)
    # This is the standard FastAPI dependency injection pattern recommended
    # in official documentation. See REMAINING_LINTING_ANALYSIS.md ยง1.
    # Example: async def endpoint(db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db))
    "B008",

    # ==========================================
    # TYPE ANNOTATION STYLE
    # ==========================================

    # ANN101: Missing type annotation for self
    # REASON: self is implicitly typed, annotating is verbose and redundant
    # This is standard Python style - self doesn't need type annotation
    "ANN101",

    # ANN102: Missing type annotation for cls
    # REASON: cls is implicitly typed in classmethods
    "ANN102",

    # ANN204: Missing return type annotation for __init__
    # REASON: __init__ always returns None, annotation is redundant
    "ANN204",

    # ==========================================
    # CODE STYLE PREFERENCES
    # ==========================================

    # COM812: Trailing comma missing
    # REASON: Trailing commas are a style preference, not a quality issue
    # Can enable later for consistency if desired
    "COM812",

    # COM819: Trailing comma prohibited
    # REASON: Conflicts with COM812, style preference
    "COM819",

    # E501: Line too long
    # REASON: Some long lines are unavoidable (SQL, complex types, URLs)
    # Keep code readable, break lines where it makes sense
    "E501",

    # ==========================================
    # ERROR HANDLING PATTERNS
    # ==========================================

    # TRY400: Use logging.exception instead of logging.error
    # REASON: We explicitly choose log level based on context
    # logging.exception is for unexpected errors only
    "TRY400",

    # TRY300: Consider moving to else block
    # REASON: Style preference, current code is readable
    "TRY300",

    # TRY301: Abstract raise to inner function
    # REASON: Over-engineering for simple error handling
    "TRY301",

    # TRY004: Prefer TypeError for invalid type
    # REASON: We use ValueError for validation, TypeError for type issues
    # Domain context determines appropriate exception type
    "TRY004",

    # ==========================================
    # LOW-VALUE RULES
    # ==========================================

    # PLR2004: Magic value in comparison
    # REASON: We use config for heuristics, but some values are inherent
    # Example: comparing to 0.0, 1.0, empty list - these are natural
    "PLR2004",

    # G004: f-string in logging
    # REASON: We use structured logging (structlog) with kwargs, not formatting
    # Few instances in legacy code, not worth retrofitting
    "G004",

    # T201: Print found
    # REASON: Print statements in demo/debug code are intentional
    # Already ignored in per-file ignores for demo module
    "T201",

    # S104: Binding to all interfaces
    # REASON: API server binding to 0.0.0.0 is intentional for Docker
    "S104",

    # ANN001: Missing type annotation for exc
    # REASON: Exception handlers have implicit exc: Exception type
    "ANN001",

    # ANN201: Missing return type annotation
    # REASON: We have 100% type coverage for public API, some internal functions exempt
    "ANN201",

    # ANN401: Disallow Any
    # REASON: Some JSONB fields legitimately use Any, type erasure at boundaries
    "ANN401",

    # ==========================================
    # INTENTIONAL PATTERNS - ALEMBIC CONVENTIONS
    # ==========================================

    # N999: Invalid module name
    # REASON: Alembic auto-generated migration filenames (2 instances)
    # Format: YYYYMMDD_HHMM-{hash}_{description}.py
    # Cannot be changed - Alembic tracks migrations by filename
    "N999",

    # E402: Module level import not at top of file
    # REASON: Alembic env.py requires path modification before imports (2 instances)
    # Must modify sys.path before importing application modules
    "E402",

    # ==========================================
    # INTENTIONAL PATTERNS - DESIGN DOCUMENTATION
    # ==========================================

    # ERA001: Found commented-out code
    # REASON: 30 instances are design notes for Phase 2/3 implementation
    # These are architectural planning comments, not dead code
    # 7 true dead code instances have been removed
    # See REMAINING_LINTING_ANALYSIS.md ยง2 for categorization
    "ERA001",

    # ==========================================
    # INTENTIONAL PATTERNS - PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE
    # ==========================================

    # ARG002: Unused method argument
    # REASON: Protocol/interface compliance (11 instances)
    # Methods must match interface signature even if some implementations
    # don't use all parameters. Example: Protocol requires existing_memory
    # but simple implementation doesn't need it
    "ARG002",

    # ARG001: Unused function argument
    # REASON: Framework hook signatures (5 instances)
    # FastAPI event hooks expect specific signatures for consistency
    "ARG001",

    # ==========================================
    # STYLE PREFERENCES
    # ==========================================

    # RET505, RET507: Unnecessary elif/else after return
    # REASON: Readability preference (12 instances)
    # Using elif/else shows mutually exclusive conditions clearly
    # Makes decision tree structure explicit
    "RET505",
    "RET507",

    # PLR0911: Too many return statements
    # REASON: Complex intent classification (2 instances)
    # Real-world business logic has many branches
    # Could refactor with lookup tables but works correctly as-is
    "PLR0911",

    # PLR0912: Too many branches
    # REASON: State machines and routing logic (2 instances)
    # Complex decision trees are inherent to business rules
    "PLR0912",

    # ==========================================
    # OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS (LOW PRIORITY)
    # ==========================================

    # RUF012: Mutable class attributes should be annotated with ClassVar
    # REASON: SQLAlchemy ORM patterns (20 instances)
    # Standard SQLAlchemy declarative base usage
    # Adding ClassVar would improve type hints but is optional
    # All instances are in infrastructure layer (models.py)
    "RUF012",

    # PLW0603: Using global statement
    # REASON: Database singleton pattern (3 instances)
    # Lazy initialization for engine and session_factory
    # Works correctly, class-based singleton would be cleaner but not urgent
    "PLW0603",

    # B007: Unused loop variable
    # REASON: Already fixed during refactoring
    # Kept here for completeness
