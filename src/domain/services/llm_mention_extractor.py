    Uses Claude Haiku 4.5 for intelligent entity extraction that handles:
    - Capitalized and lowercase entities ("Apple" and "apple")
    - Typos and variations ("Aple" â†’ "Apple")
    - Context-aware extraction (knows when "Call" is a verb vs entity)
    - Complex patterns (multi-word entities, pronouns, identifiers)

    Vision Alignment:
    - Trust LLM intelligence over brittle patterns
    - Semantic understanding over regex matching
    - Graceful handling of edge cases
    - Composable with existing pipeline

    This is a drop-in replacement for SimpleMentionExtractor with the same interface.
