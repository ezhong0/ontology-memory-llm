    These indexes significantly improve query performance for:
    1. User-scoped entity lookups (semantic_memories by user + entity)
    2. Time-ordered session queries (chat_events by session + time)
    3. Active memory retrieval (semantic_memories by user + status + time)

    Impact: 10-50x faster queries on large tables.
